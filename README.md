## Description

SportSpot is an application where sports enthusiasts in NYC can connect virtually to make plans to connect in real life. 

Athetes are always looking for other players to join them and coaches are always looking to find new players to coach. SportSpot was built to bridge that gap. 

The app allows users to browse posts by sport made by other users and create posts of their own. Users can find players to join in a pickup game, a coach to schedule a 1:1 session, and more!
